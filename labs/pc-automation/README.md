# Prisma Cloud Automation Labs

## Labs/Ideas
1. API Intro - Further simplify and move Vault to a separate lab.  Also add reference to API Request Types somewhere.  Or maybe in 2nd lab...
2. API GET - Consider adding Kyle's stuff to the end.
3. Additional API Request Labs, such as a POST & PUT request.  Maybe add a custom Policy, other ideas.
4. API Lab that refreshes an access key
5. API Lab Add-ons: Vault, CI/CD with Git triggers
