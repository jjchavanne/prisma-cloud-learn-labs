# Text Editors

A very short list of some common text editors.  Note I've provided some direct links, but use Google to search for others if you like:

Typically installed on Linux and Mac by default and easy to start with:
- [nano](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-nano-text-editor/)
   
Typically installed on Linux and Mac by default, much more powerful than nano but much steeper learning curve:
- [vim](https://medium.com/swlh/getting-started-with-vim-3f11fc4f62c4).
   
Edit inside a common IDE:
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)
